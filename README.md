# Oral Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project aims to build a deep learning model that classifies oral diseases from images. The model uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification. The goal is to classify images into categories such as **healthy**, **gingivitis**, **dental caries**, and others.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizing, converting to grayscale, and normalizing image data.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping applied to training images.
- **Model Training**: A CNN model is trained to classify oral disease images.
- **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to measure performance.
